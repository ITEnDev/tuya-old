# What?

This is a copy of the old official Tuya integration from Home Assistant 2021.9.7, copied from the [repo](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/2021.9.7/homeassistant/components/tuya).

# Why?

In Home Assistant 2021.10.0 the Tuya integration was replaced with Tuya v2, and, unfortunately, some
of the devices are not supported there.

# How?

Add this repo to HACS and install `Tuya (old)` integration.
